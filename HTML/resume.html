<li>You may include scholarships, awards, recognition of academic achievement, etc.</li><br>


<li>If you have items that could fall in either category, use a combined section.</li><br>

<li>If you have one item under the category of honors, combine it or list it elsewhere: it would look silly to list one item under a plural heading.</li><br></ul></h4>

If you have a certification or licensure (i.e., teaching certification, Engineer-in-Training, fitness certification, CPR, first aid, scuba diving, etc.) related to your career objective, include a "certifications" or "licensure" heading and give this information. Place this section higher on your resume page than other less related information.</li><br>


<li>If your certification is not related to your objective, and is not significant enough to need its own section, but is generally useful information (example: CPR, first aid, but job does not require this), you could list this in another category with an appropriate heading such as "other activities," "activities and certifications," etc.</li><ul><br>
